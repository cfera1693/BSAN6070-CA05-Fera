## Content

1) "CA05_Logistic_Regression_Part_A_Carla_Fera.ipynb" (Python Notebook).
2) "CA05_kNN_Part_B_Carla_Fera.ipynb" (Python Notebook).
2) "Logistic Regression CA05 - Carla Fera" (PDF). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. These instructions apply for the python notebook. 

### Prerequisites

1) A computer with Wi-Fi connection.
2) A web browser (any of your preference). 
2) An account on Google-Drive.
3) Basic knowledgement in using computers, Internet and Google Colaboratory. 

### Steps

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1) Download the files attached to this repository. 
2) Open your web browser and navigate to your Google Drive account. 
3) In your Google Drive account, click in New -> More.. -> Google Colaboratory.
4) In your new Google Colab file, go to File -> Open notebook.. 
5) Upload the data file attached to this repository called "CA05_Logistic_Regression_Part_A_Carla_Fera.ipynb".
The code should appear in the screen, with the corresponding outputs. This means that you don't need to run it.
6) Repeat the same steps to open the python notebook called "CA05_kNN_Part_B_Carla_Fera.ipynb".

In case you want to run the code yourself follow steps bellow. 

7) Click on Runtime -> Run all.

In addition, it is valid to use the notebooks on other programming environments, like Anaconda.
